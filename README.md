UCI Bootcamp: Unsupervised Machine Learning on Myopia Data

Utilize unsupervised machine learning to categorize patients with myopia (nearsightedness) into distinct groups. Dimensionality reduction was done with PCA and t-SNE to reduce the number of features to 0.90 variance and dataset dimensions. K-means clustering was used to identify the best amount of clusters and to categorize the patients into these clusters.

As a result of this analysis, it was found that the myopia patients can be clustered into 5 distinct groups.
